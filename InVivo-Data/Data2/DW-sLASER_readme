Dataset 2: acquired in the human brain (posterior cingulate cortex, VOI 20x20x20) with a DW-sLASER sequence (TE=125ms) at 7Tesla (Philips scanner) 

The DW-sLASER sequence is set as follows: the diffusion gradients had a duration of 8ms and duration between the begin of the first and second diffusion blocks 
(diffusion time) was 60ms. See provided schematic for sequence details.

Metabolites dataset was acquired with:
-- 3 diffusion gradient amplitudes (G=10, 18 and 26mT) and along 3 orthogonal directions ([1,1,-0.5],[-0.5,1,1],[1,-0.5,1])
-- a total of 24 averages per condition (for each b-value and direction)
-- VAPOR scheme (with squeezed delays) for water suppression
-- PPU for cardiac triggering
-- other acquisition parameters npoints = 1024, spectral width=3000 Hz

Water dataset was acquired with:
-- exactly same parameters but without water suppresion and with a lower number of averages
-- a total of 4 averages per condition

We provide:
-- A file with data for metabolites after coil-combination, e.g. a total of 24x3x3=216 spectra, each with 1024 points
      --> The data are given in a .mat format (dimensions are (npoints,#bvaluex#direction,average). 
          In the second dimension, the data are organized as follow: [b1-dir,b1-dir2,b1-dir3,b2-dir1,b2-dir2,b2-dir3,b3-dir,b3-dir2,b3-dir3]
      --> The data are given in a .SPAR/.SDAT format: the array is saved as follow: [(av1,b1),(av1,b2),...,(av1,b9),(av2,b1),(av2,b2),...,(av2,b9),...(av32,b1),(av32,b2),...,(av32,b9)].
      
-- A file with data for water after coil-combination, e.g. a total of 4x3x3=36 spectra, each with 1024 points
      --> Data are saved similarly as for metab.
      
-- A file with all b-values (which account for the cross terms with imaging gradients)
-- A file with sequence chronograms (for each gradient amplitude and direction)
-- A basis-set for analysis of the spectra with LCModel or other preferred software
-- A control file for analysis with LCModel (this gives help to get started, but feel free to adapt to your preferred parameters)
-- A 3dT1 image (after fsl_deface).
