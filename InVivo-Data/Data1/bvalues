# b-values

The data were acquired with 4 diffusion gradient amplitudes and along 3 orthogonal directions. 

In the folder "chronogram", you can find 9 .csv files. In each one of those files you find the chronogram for Gx, Gy, Gz (all gradients) and RF. The sampling interval is 6.4 us. 

Below are all b-values:

-- G=0mT: b=0s/mm2

-- G=15mT, direction [1,1,-0.5]: b=907s/mm2
-- G=25mT, direction [1,1,-0.5]: b=2155s/mm2
-- G=35mT, direction [1,1,-0.5]: b=3956s/mm2

-- G=15mT, direction [1,-0.5,1]: b=903s/mm2
-- G=25mT, direction [1,-0.5,1]: b=2148s/mm2
-- G=35mT, direction [1,-0.5,1]: b=3945s/mm2

-- G=15mT, direction [-0.5,1,1]: b=901s/mm2
-- G=25mT, direction [-0.5,1,1]: b=2144s/mm2
-- G=35mT, direction [-0.5,1,1]: b=3940s/mm2
